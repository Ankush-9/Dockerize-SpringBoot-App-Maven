This is a Guide to Dockerize the Application in the Repository 

The original Code for this console based application is taken from ~ https://github.com/Haider7214/SpringBoot.git

First of all we need to be connected to our Linux VM(Any flavour of your choice) and install the following~
*I have used Amazon Linux

sudo yum install maven -y 
sudo yum install git -y
sudo yum install docker -y
docker systemctl start docker 
docker systemctl enable docker

#exit and reconnect to the VM on your Terminal

git clone git@github.com:Ankush-9/Dockerizing-Maven-Springboot-App.git
ls -l
cd Dockerizing-Maven-Springboot-App.git
ls -l
cd SringBoot
ls -l
mvn clean package

*If you clone project from original authors repo remember to edit the pom.xml and use java.verion as to be 17 rather than 21

cd target 
ls -l

#We require a .jar file which must be present and visible after we hit the above command

cd ..
docker login

	#Provide your DockerHub username and Password to connect to your Account for push operations

vi Dockerfile
	i
	
	FROM eclipse-temurin:17-jdk-jammy
	MAINTAINER <your-name> <your-email>
	COPY target/<app-name.jar> /usr/app/
	EXPOSE 8080
	WORKDIR /usr/app
	ENTRYPOINT ["java" ,"-jar" ,"<app-name.jar>"]

	esc 
	:wq + ENTER

docker build -t sboot-app .
docker images
	#To verify image is present 
docker tag sboot-app <docker-acc-username>/sboot-app:<tag>
docker push <docker-acc-username>/sboot-app:<tag>	

	#Go to your Docker hub account and verify the image under Profile >> "My Hub" Section

To run the project~

docker run -d sboot-app
docker ps -a
	#copy container-id
docker logs <container-id>
	#As stated earlier it's a console based app so the information and working are displayed under logs.

# Pushing Image to DockerHub Account
If you want to push this app to your DockerHub Account ,First of all amke sure you are logged in to your dockerHub account(if not use ~ docker login)and provide credentials then ~

docker tag <image-name> <dockerhub-username>/<image-name>:<tag>
docker push <dockerhub-username>/<image-name>:<tag>

*Verify whether the image has been pushed or not by Going to DockerHub-->My Profile-->My Hub
